## Brief overview

Collagen‑VI muscular dystrophies are neuromuscular disorders with musculoskeletal and respiratory implications. In emergencies, airway management, gentle handling, and respiratory support require special attention.

## General immediate measures

- Gentle handling and positioning; prevent pressure sores.
- Early airway assessment; difficult airway may occur.
- Consider respiratory insufficiency; monitor SpO₂/CO₂.
- Beware of fracture risk (possible reduced bone density).
- Early mobilisation/physiotherapy after stabilisation when feasible.

## Contraindications / Caution

- Avoid unnecessary immobilisation (risk of contractures).
- Verify medications and interventions against up‑to‑date guidance.
- When uncertain, consult specialised centres early.

## Notes for EMS and Emergency Department

- Have an airway plan including alternatives available.
- Use careful transfer and repositioning techniques.
- Initiate respiratory support as indicated.

## Notes for Anaesthesia/Intensive Care

- Preoperative airway assessment and difficult airway strategy.
- Consider postoperative respiratory monitoring and physiotherapy.
- Adapt analgesia/positioning to musculoskeletal considerations.
